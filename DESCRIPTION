Description: It has often been said that "prediction is difficult, especially 
  about the future."  When testing a prediction algorithm, it is essential that
  the algorithm not have access to data that arose after the moment for which 
  the prediction is sought.  Said another way, access to future data renders any
  prediction meaningless. However, due to data management and programming
  mistakes, it is common for testing to go awry due to accidentally giving an 
  algorithm access to such "future data".  This is not the fault of the 
  programmer, but simply due to the lack of an opaque barrier between algorithm
  and test.  Here, I provide such a barrier.  By using the testing framework
  provided in this package, researchers can ensure that "future peek" errors
  are avoided.
